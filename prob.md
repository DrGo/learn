# Random Variable
- not random and not variable.
- func from the O sample space to R assigning a real value to each sampling outcome.
- eg sampling from students,  H is an r.v. or func that takes a particular student (randomly sampled) and give his height h.
- H is a func. h is a numerical value.
- B is another r.v. defined as W/H2. 
- eg r+x is an r.v. defined as the func that returns r+x when R=r and X=x (both R and X are r.v.)
- so can have several r.v. on the same O space.
- r.v. can have either discrete or continous values.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- pX(x) = P(X=x); it gives the probability that X will have the value x.
- px(x) = P({w )
- can be viewed as a bar chart, x-axis is x; y-axis is pX(x).
